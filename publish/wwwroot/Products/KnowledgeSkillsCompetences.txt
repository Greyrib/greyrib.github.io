Here’s a brief differentiation of knowledge, skills, and competences in the context of learning:

    Knowledge: What you know—facts, concepts, theories, and principles learned through education or experience. (E.g., knowing the rules of grammar in a language.)
    Skills: What you can do—the ability to apply knowledge in a practical way, often requiring practice. (E.g., writing a well-structured essay.)
    Competences: What you are capable of—a combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that enable effective performance in a real-world context. (E.g., communicating effectively in a professional setting.)

Competences are broader because they involve applying knowledge and skills in different situations.

Here’s how knowledge, skills, and competences relate to Computer Science:

    Knowledge: Understanding concepts, theories, and principles.
    E.g., Knowing data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees) and algorithms (sorting, searching, etc.).

    Skills: The ability to apply knowledge in practical tasks.
    E.g., Writing efficient code in Python, debugging programs, or implementing a sorting algorithm.

    Competences: The ability to solve real-world problems using knowledge and skills in various contexts.
    E.g., Designing scalable software architectures, optimizing database queries for performance, or leading a development team in a project.
